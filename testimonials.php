            <p>This kitchen renovation is the second project that you have done for us and you have given us a lot of confidence and trust in your work. The entire process was professional and efficient. You were cooperative in accommodating our requirements especially as the renovation was done during the peak of winter. You ensured that disruption was kept to a minimum and were always available to answer our queries. You gave us a realistic schedule and kept to the schedule (for both projects) and always kept us informed on progress.</p>
            <blockquote>We are delighted with the design quality and pleasant friendly service we received during the whole process. Annie and Sky</blockquote>
            <p>We will definitely recommend you to our friends for any renovation works. Overall this has been a very pleasant experience for us, and we will not hesitate to engage your services again.</p>

            <p>Chapman Built was recommended to us via word of mouth. We ran our own tender process, looking for a builder who would translate our architectural plans into a tangible structure.  We wanted to work directly with the builder rather than using a middle man. It was clear from the start that Luke and Peter would be the ones to do this for us with Luke, in particular, at the operational helm. He understands quality, has good attention to detail and his communication skills are exceptional.</p>
            <blockquote>If we had an issue, he would listen, consider it and work through it with us until we had a solution that met our design and his practical requirements. - Emily and Andy</blockquote>
            <p>He would provide timely responses to e-mails, phone calls or texts and always kept us informed about progress, what decisions needed to be made and by when. He employed responsive contractors and the project came in on budget. We are now planning our next addition and will certainly be asking Chapman Built to tender.</p>

            <p>Chapman Built recently renovated our bathroom and kitchen. Our bathroom was completely renovated and new kitchen joinery was supplied and installed. We were very happy with both the process and the completed result. We would not hesitate to recommend Chapman Built to future clients. During the process we were kept informed on a daily basis about what to expect. All the visiting tradesmen were professional, polite and friendly. When decisions were required about the details along the way, good advice and information were clearly communicated while the final choices were respectfully left to us. With only one bathroom in our house every effort was made to minimise the time and inconvenience of being without it.</p>
            <blockquote>In particular, Chapman Built listened to our concerns and ensured that disruption to the operation of our bathroom was minimised. - Anna and David</blockquote>
            <p>Luke has a particularly good eye for detail that makes the finished product work so well. Nothing was too much trouble and when we raised any issues along the way, they were dealt with quickly and with goodwill.</p>

            <p>Whenever we first interviewed builders for our renovation, Luke Chapman stood out as being on time, upfront, and practical. He discussed our ideas, talked us through the various options to achieve our design while keeping costs within budget. We really appreciated that he worked with us to enable us to stay in the house for the majority of the time, even to the extent of building a false wall to enable us to inhabit part of the house while he renovated at the back. Throughout the build he communicated extensively with us to discuss choices, issues, and options. His estimates for work were always accurate.</p>
            <blockquote>He and the tradesmen he works with went the extra mile to ensure the end product was of the highest quality. - Karen and David</blockquote>
            <p>The people he works with are polite and tidy and their work is to a consistent and immaculate standard. It is impossible to tell where the old part of our house ends and the new part begins - the renovation is seamless and we are incredibly happy with the end result. Through effective communication and flexibility, we remained within our budget and the project was completed in a timeframe we were very happy with. We plan to renovate our bathrooms in a couple of years and there is no reason whatever we would look to engage anyone else but Luke and his Company; Chapman Built.</p>

            <p>Chapman Built created a beautiful bathroom for us. With his expertise in many areas of building, Luke patiently helped us tweak our design to get the most out of the space. His attention to detail, flexibility, reliability, commitment to quality and excellent communications made the whole build run very smoothly.</p>

            <p>We had Chapman Built undertake a makeover to modernise our kitchen. We found they provided quality workmanship and were very reliable, friendly and punctual.</p>

            <p>Having Chapman Built to manage our renovations meant we were saved the worry of finding and managing tradesmen who could deliver a high quality service on time and on budget. We were on a time limit and Luke made sure that all elements of the project flowed seamlessly. All we needed to do was select colours, fittings and appliances.</p>

               	<h2>Energy efficiency</h2>
                <p>This renovation project involved increasing the energy efficiency and usability of the original and architecturally designed Campbell home. The existing single glazed windows with poor sealing qualities were replaced with high efficiency double glazed aluminium windows. The high level windows that were once difficult to open were given electric opening mechanisms which Chapman Built adapted to suit the specific openings of the windows and challenging architectural features of the house. The end result is windows with a ‘factory’ appearance that compliment the original architectural intent yet also exhibit excellent energy performance and user friendly operation. A new shower room was installed to make better use of a wasted cupboard room, and the rest of the home was given a makeover with new paint and a stylish new entry hall handrail. </p>

                <p>Dear Luke,<br>
Anthony and I would very much like to thank you for your work with us. We were so excited to hear that you won the award for the best renovation under $150,000 at this year’s MBA awards – it could not have gone to a better person.</p>
<p>We would be happy to tell anyone (and we do, at any opportunity) how much we appreciated your skill, your professionalism and your knowledge. Working with you was an absolute pleasure. We valued that we could rely on your advice and guidance to be in our best interest and to be absolutely best practice.</p>
<p>After all the stories we had heard in the past from friends about renovating, we were relieved and very pleasantly surprised at how much effort you put into reducing our inconvenience, and we were also very grateful for your reliability. When you said something would happen, it happened; when you said you’d be coming around, you did; when we called you, you called back; and when we had questions you answered them fully and knowledgeably. We very quickly realised that we could trust you completely and it was a great relief to know that you cared as much about making the renovation the best it could be as we did.</p>
<p>We love our 'new home' so much. Every day I wake up and head out into the kitchen I feel like I’m on holiday – it’s made a real difference to our enjoyment of our home and to our lifestyle. You turned our little, poky, dark house into a thing of beauty and everything was done to the highest standard.</p>
<p>We would recommend you to anyone. I know I’ve said this to you many times but I’ll say it again: if we ever decide to build a home from scratch, we’ll be coming straight to you! <br>
Best wishes,<br>
Gina and Anthony</p></blockquote>

                <p>Our latest experience of extending and renovating our home has been incredibly positive and enjoyable. The working relationship we were able to develop with the builder, Luke Chapman of Chapman Built, and the expert trades he employed, was largely due to the clear and open communication that he cultivated. The high level of finished workmanship expected by him and therefore delivered, has created a home that is both functional and beautiful.</p>
<p>His ability to develop a close and collaborative working relationship with our architect, Jeremy Mather of Mather Architects, ensured details and issues were discussed and resolved, delivering optimum outcomes.
All queries and requests were deliberated and dealt with in a timely and efficient manner, always with the view to providing the best outcome for the build and us, the clients. Nothing was ever too hard.</p>
<p>Attention to detail was amazing. Luke sourced products that are bespoke so that the visual integrity and the functionality of areas impacted positively on the overall finish. One example of this is the hanging system for the gallery/studio door. Luke somehow found a gentleman who had invented a small swinging mechanism that would allow the door to swing open both sides but remain flat when closed so that visually it did not impact on the gallery space and the mechanism would be hidden.  While this seems a small element, it is an example of the attention to detail that was evident throughout the build.</p>
<p>Luke’s confidence in being able to complete this build with challenges like installing the large precast wall, the burnished concrete floors and the large sliding wall into a period home gave us the confidence to proceed with our vision.</p>
<p>Expert advice was always available.  Lighting, colours, functionality of spaces and finishes were gladly discussed at length with us and his insight and experience helped guide us. We were pleased to have such knowledge apparent and accessible. We always felt that we were in control of the build, that it was ultimately ours, but the level of interest and commitment by Luke and his trades made the project enjoyable, collaborative and we think exceptional.
<p>The professional expertise, clear communication and attention to details both large and small have been remarkable. We have been delivered a home that is finished to an extraordinarily high level. It is a home that we are very proud of and enjoy every day.</p>
<p>If we were to build or renovate again we would definitely engage Chapman Built. We have readily recommended this company on many occasions. We cannot recommend Luke highly enough and we thank him for a wonderful home.<br>

            <p>This kitchen renovation is the second project that you have done for us and you have given us a lot of confidence and trust in your work. The entire process was professional and efficient. You were cooperative in accommodating our requirements especially as the renovation was done during the peak of winter. You ensured that disruption was kept to a minimum and were always available to answer our queries. You gave us a realistic schedule and kept to the schedule (for both projects) and always kept us informed on progress.</p>

            <p>We will definitely recommend you to our friends for any renovation works. Overall this has been a very pleasant experience for us, and we will not hesitate to engage your services again.</p>

            <p>Chapman Built was recommended to us via word of mouth. We ran our own tender process, looking for a builder who would translate our architectural plans into a tangible structure.  We wanted to work directly with the builder rather than using a middle man. It was clear from the start that Luke and Peter would be the ones to do this for us with Luke, in particular, at the operational helm. He understands quality, has good attention to detail and his communication skills are exceptional.</p>
            <blockquote>If we had an issue, he would listen, consider it and work through it with us until we had a solution that met our design and his practical requirements. - Emily and Andy</blockquote>
            <p>He would provide timely responses to e-mails, phone calls or texts and always kept us informed about progress, what decisions needed to be made and by when. He employed responsive contractors and the project came in on budget. We are now planning our next addition and will certainly be asking Chapman Built to tender.</p>

            <p>Chapman Built recently renovated our bathroom and kitchen. Our bathroom was completely renovated and new kitchen joinery was supplied and installed. We were very happy with both the process and the completed result. We would not hesitate to recommend Chapman Built to future clients. During the process we were kept informed on a daily basis about what to expect. All the visiting tradesmen were professional, polite and friendly. When decisions were required about the details along the way, good advice and information were clearly communicated while the final choices were respectfully left to us. With only one bathroom in our house every effort was made to minimise the time and inconvenience of being without it.</p>
            <blockquote>In particular, Chapman Built listened to our concerns and ensured that disruption to the operation of our bathroom was minimised. - Anna and David</blockquote>
            <p>Luke has a particularly good eye for detail that makes the finished product work so well. Nothing was too much trouble and when we raised any issues along the way, they were dealt with quickly and with goodwill.</p>

            <p>Whenever we first interviewed builders for our renovation, Luke Chapman stood out as being on time, upfront, and practical. He discussed our ideas, talked us through the various options to achieve our design while keeping costs within budget. We really appreciated that he worked with us to enable us to stay in the house for the majority of the time, even to the extent of building a false wall to enable us to inhabit part of the house while he renovated at the back. Throughout the build he communicated extensively with us to discuss choices, issues, and options. His estimates for work were always accurate.</p>
            <blockquote>He and the tradesmen he works with went the extra mile to ensure the end product was of the highest quality. - Karen and David</blockquote>
            <p>The people he works with are polite and tidy and their work is to a consistent and immaculate standard. It is impossible to tell where the old part of our house ends and the new part begins - the renovation is seamless and we are incredibly happy with the end result. Through effective communication and flexibility, we remained within our budget and the project was completed in a timeframe we were very happy with. We plan to renovate our bathrooms in a couple of years and there is no reason whatever we would look to engage anyone else but Luke and his Company; Chapman Built.</p>

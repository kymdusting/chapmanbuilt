                <h1>Heritage home with modern influence</h1>
                <p>This 1920’s Canberra cottage was extended and completed overhauled to create a modern and comfortable family home with two difference personalities. The original house was extended with heritage cues including timber double hung windows with custom ‘horned’ sashes, timber floor boards, and timber ceiling features and hanging rails. A new kitchen with Carrara stone benchtops and splashbacks was installed under a partly-removed heritage chimney, suspended with steel supports.</p>
                <p>The existing home and heritage garage were connected with an industrial inspired Gallery Wing, which features a giant pre-cast concrete wall and matching burnished concrete floor. The wall splits the space into a main bedroom quarters and an art gallery. Carefully aligned bulkheads and stepped ceilings are covered by a complex roof and hidden gutter system. A 3.3 metre long, custom designed and custom made sliding door splits the bedroom from the gallery. The luxurious ensuite features a freestanding bath, with custom joinery and floor to ceiling concrete-inspired tiles. The pre-cast wall is not only a talking point, but creates a special art hanging space, as well as providing valuable thermal mass for comfortable living.</p>
                <p>The project involved the use of a diverse range of materials and construction methods which completely transformed the layout of the original home whilst maintaining its heritage character.</p>

                <h1>Award winning townhouse renovation</h1>
                <p>Chapman Built carried out a major renovation to a town residence in Holder to create an open living space with a modern kitchen and laundry and improved access to the rear courtyard. </p>
                <p>Internal walls separating Kitchen, Dining and Living were removed.  A structural steel beam was installed above a new energy efficient double glazed sliding door and fixed window. This allowed natural light to flow from front to back of the home.</p>
                <p>New joinery was installed with a high level of craftsmanship and attention to detail that used vinyl wrapped handle-less doors to create a seamless and modern look. The dark colours of the Kitchen benchtop are mimicked by a feature bulkhead that runs the entire width of the space.  The dark rust-effect paint appears to match the drop of the waterfall edge on the bench with great effect. Additional joinery was installed either side of a fire place to integrate the Kitchen and Living spaces. The Living Room joinery uses timber on the benchtops to match that used in the floor.</p>
                <p>Extra wide, 180mm, Sydney blue gum solid timber flooring was installed throughout the living areas to give a sense of warmth to the space. Other features include matching stone splashbacks, under-mount kitchen sink, pendant lighting, bright red entry door and a commercial-style cavity sliding door for the Laundry that uses a full height custom door.</p>
                <p>This project represents the result of redefining the space within to create a modern, light and spacious place to call home.</p>
                <p class="award award-2015">This project was awarded the winner of the 2015 MBA ACT Awards, Best Remodelling Project less than $150,000.</p>

                <p>This ex-government home was completely transformed and extended to create an environmentally friendly and modern family residence. A striking skillion roof was used on the extension, with raking ceilings to allow sunlight to enter in the winter months and warm the burnished concrete floor. Quality double glazed windows and insulation to floors, walls and ceilings dramatically improved the thermal comfort of this home throughout the year. Bespoke joinery with ash veneer finishes is a highlight, and contrasts beautifully with the recycled blackbutt flooring, cedar windows, and ash trims to provide a natural feel.</p>

The kitchen features generous amounts of storage and bench space including a hidden butler’s pantry that incorporates the laundry. Outdoor entertaining is an ease with the large deck with pergola leading straight out from the dining area. The main bedroom addition includes a large walk-in-robe and ensuite. Double glazed windows and floor, wall and ceiling insulation all combine to improve the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of the home bringing it into the 21st century.</p>

                <p>This Canberra duplex was completely renovated throughout the ground floor to transform the home into a modern and chic space. Structural steelwork was installed to completely open up the Kitchen, Dining and Living areas which created a bright and airy feel. The new kitchen was relocated to provide direct access to the new merbau timber deck at the rear. New custom made joinery was installed to the Kitchen, Living, new Study and Laundry to maximise storage and functionality. The kitchen features soft closing drawers and doors, double drawer dish washer and a central island bench with waterfall ends. All ground floor windows were replaced with energy efficient double glazed timber framed windows. The update included new lighting and bamboo flooring to the living areas. The façade of the home was given a modern update with the addition of a timber pergola, paving and a funky new opening to the porch wall.</p>

This extension project  created a dramatic new kitchen and dining space to this family home. The kitchen features 30mm stone benchtops with a large island bench acting as a family hub. Abundant efficient storage space is provided from the overhead cupboard and underbench drawers. Multiple food preparation areas are possible with the use of separate sinks, with double ovens and induction cooking options. The splashback uses a combination of manufactured stone and glass. The energy efficiency of the space was maximised with all new windows using double glazing and additional wall and ceiling insulation installed.</p>

                <p>The existing bathroom and laundry rooms were each transformed into modern and attractive rooms with the addition of custom made joinery with manufactured stone benchtops. The main bathroom was combined with the WC and a new window installed above the new bath. The rooms were professionally designed with stylish tile and accessory selections chosen to complement each space.</p>
                <p>The client requested the services of Chapman Built for a second renovation that involved the removal of internal walls and the installation of professionally designed and custom made joinery to the kitchen. Features included vinyl wrapped soft-closing doors and drawers and 40mm stone to the island bench.</p>

               	<h1>Energy efficiency</h1>
                <p>This renovation project involved increasing the energy efficiency and usability of the original and architecturally designed Campbell home. The existing single glazed windows with poor sealing qualities were replaced with high efficiency double glazed aluminium windows. The high level windows that were once difficult to open were given electric opening mechanisms which Chapman Built adapted to suit the specific openings of the windows and challenging architectural features of the house. The end result is windows with a ‘factory’ appearance that compliment the original architectural intent yet also exhibit excellent energy performance and user friendly operation. A new shower room was installed to make better use of a wasted cupboard room, and the rest of the home was given a makeover with new paint and a stylish new entry hall handrail. </p>

                <p>This project was a shop fitout carried out within the Majura Park complex to accommodate a new store. The one month timeframe was part of the challenge to create a space that included a new coolroom, plus associated electrical, security and plumbing services. Custom made joinery, timber and aluminium facade materials were installed together with effective lighting to create a fresh and welcoming space.  The communication between Chapman Built and the head contractor, it’s associated trades and Chapman Built subcontractors was paramount to the successful outcome of achieving the completed project within the required schedule. </p>

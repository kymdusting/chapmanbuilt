               	<h2>Commercial space renovation</h2>
                <p>This project was a shop fitout carried out within the Majura Park complex to accommodate a new store. The one month timeframe was part of the challenge to create a space that included a new coolroom, plus associated electrical, security and plumbing services. Custom made joinery, timber and aluminium facade materials were installed together with effective lighting to create a fresh and welcoming space.  The communication between Chapman Built and the head contractor, it’s associated trades and Chapman Built subcontractors was paramount to the successful outcome of achieving the completed project within the required schedule. </p>
